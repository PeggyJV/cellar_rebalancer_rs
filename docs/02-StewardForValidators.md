# Validators Instructions for Setting Up Steward

Steward is a side-car process that connects the Sommelier chain to the outside world. It provides an API for Strategy Providers to rebalance Cellars through the Sommelier validator set based on off-chain calculations. Additionally, it subsumes the functionality of gorc for managing the [Gravity bridge Orchestrator](https://github.com/PeggyJV/gravity-bridge/tree/main/orchestrator), and provides developer tools and features for developing and testing Cellars.

Steward runs on every Validator in the Sommelier Validator set. It runs a server to which Strategy Providers (SPs) send requests whenever they determine that the market has changed enough to warrant action. The request payload contains everything needed to make a *cork*: a signed combination of a cellar address and an ABI encoded contract call. When Steward receives a submission from the SP, it validates the target cellar address, builds a cork, signs it with the delegate key, and submits it to the [Cork module](https://github.com/peggyjv/sommelier/tree/main/x/cork) on chain.

> :bulb:  Steward gatekeeps function calls both by only supporting certain Cellar functions in its API, and by validating the target cellar before forwarding a call.  

## Quickstart

To start Steward, simply run

```bash
steward -c [path to your config toml] start
```

> :warning: If this is production, don't forget to make sure the Orchestrator is also running! If you don't, you can be jailed and your submitted corks will not be processed.
See the [Orchestrator Quickstart](./docs/03-TheOrchestrator.md#quickstart) section of the docs. 

## Setting Up Steward

In this section, letâ€™s explore setting up steward for validators.

### Running Steward as a server

Before SPs can establish a connection with your `steward` server, you will need to generate a CA, a TLS certificate signed by this CA, and you'll need to the SP's client CA. These certificates must be TLS 1.2 compliant. The paths to these values and the key used to create your signed server certificate must be configured in the `[server]` table of your config file. Starting out, Sommelier will be running the only SP, and our client CA cert can be found in the `tls/` directory of this repo. You will use this path for the `client_ca_cert_path` field in your config TOML.

Other important configuration fields like your Sommelier node's endpoint are also required so that Steward knows where to send corks. Here is an [example configuration](./01-Configuration.md#complete-example-configtoml) you can use to get your config file started. Most of the fields have sensible defaults; you can use the [configuration reference](./01-Configuration.md#reference) to determine which fields you don't need to explicity set if you wish.

Once your certs and config file are ready and your Sommelier node is running, refer to the [Quickstart section](#quickstart) above to start Steward!
